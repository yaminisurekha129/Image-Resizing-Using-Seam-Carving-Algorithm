Python code for Image Resizing Using Seam Carving Algorithm.
Step1: Import Libraries
1. os: It is likely used for handling file paths and operations related to the file system.
2. numpy (np): The `numpy` module is a powerful library for numerical computations 
in Python. It is likely used for array manipulation and calculations related to image 
processing.
3. PIL (Python Imaging Library): The `PIL` module, also known as `Pillow`, is a 
popular library for image processing tasks in Python. It provides functions and 
classes for loading, manipulating, and saving images.
4. ImageFilter: The `ImageFilter` module within `PIL` provides various image filtering 
operations. It is used here to apply filters to the image, possibly for enhancing edges 
or extracting features.
5. Flask: `Flask` is a micro web framework for building web applications in Python. It 
provides tools and libraries for handling HTTP requests, rendering templates, and 
creating web forms. It is used here to create a web application with functionality for 
uploading images, specifying dimensions, and displaying the resized image.
6. FlaskForm: The `FlaskForm` class from `flask_wtf` module is an extension for Flask 
that integrates with WTForms library. It provides convenient features for creating 
and validating web forms in Flask applications.
7. render_template: The `render_template` function from `flask` module is used to 
render HTML templates. It allows for dynamic content generation and displaying 
data within HTML files.
8. redirect, url_for: These functions from `flask` module are used for redirecting the 
user to a different route or URL after a successful operation. They help in controlling 
the flow of the application.
9. secure_filename: The `secure_filename` function from `werkzeug.utils` module is 
used to sanitize and secure the filename of the uploaded image. It removes any 
potentially harmful characters or path components to prevent security 
vulnerabilities.
10. FileField, IntegerField, SubmitField: These classes from `wtforms` module are 
used for creating form fields with specific input types. `FileField` is used for 
uploading files, `IntegerField` is used for specifying integer values, and 
`SubmitField` represents a submit button.
11. DataRequired, NumberRange: These validators from `wtforms.validators` 
module are used to enforce data validation rules on form fields. `DataRequired` 
ensures that the field is not empty, while `NumberRange` checks if the entered value 
falls within a specified range.# Image-Resizing-Using-Seam-Carving-Algorithm.

Step2:
1. app = Flask(__name__): This line creates a Flask application object called app. 
The __name__ parameter is a special Python variable that represents the name 
of the current module. This line initializes the Flask application.
2. app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key': This line sets the value of the 
SECRET_KEY configuration option for the Flask application. The secret key is 
used for encrypting session cookies and other security-related purposes. It should 
be a long, random string and kept secret to ensure the security of the application.

3. app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads': This line sets the value of the 
UPLOAD_FOLDER configuration option for the Flask application. It specifies 
the folder where uploaded files will be stored. In this case, the 'uploads' folder is 
used, but you can modify it to the desired folder name or path on your system.

Step3:
This is a FlaskForm subclass called `ImageForm`. This class represents a form with 
three fields: "Image", "Width", and "Height". Let's explain each line of code:
The `ImageForm` class defines the structure and validation rules for the form used to 
upload an image and specify the desired width and height for resizing. It allows the 
Flask application to handle form submissions, validate the input, and retrieve the 
entered values for further processing.

Step4: Defining Energy map unction
The `energy_map` function takes an image as input, converts it to grayscale, calculates 
the gradients in both horizontal and vertical directions, resizes the vertical gradient 
array, and computes the energy map by combining the gradient magnitudes. The energy 
map represents the image's visual importance or energy distribution, which is utilized 
19
in the seam carving algorithm for determining the optimal seams to remove during 
resizing.

Step5:
The `seam_carving` function encapsulates the seam carving algorithm, taking an input 
image and the desired width and height for resizing. It calculates the energy map, 
performs dynamic programming to find the minimum energy seam, removes the seam, 
and resizes the image accordingly. The function returns the resized image.
The loop iterates over the rows of the dynamic programming matrix (`for row in 
range(1, height)`) and performs dynamic programming to find the minimum energy 
seam:
-`dp[row, 0] += min(dp[row - 1, 0], dp[row - 1, 1])`: This line updates the dynamic 
programming matrix by adding the minimum energy value from the above left and 
above right pixels to the current pixel in the first column -`dp[row, width - 1] += min(dp[row - 1, width - 2], dp[row - 1, width - 1])`: This line 
updates the dynamic programming matrix by adding the minimum energy value from 
the above left and above right pixels to the current pixel in the last column.
-The inner loop `for col in range(1, width - 1)` updates the dynamic programming 
matrix for the pixels in the middle columns. The current pixel value is updated by 
adding the minimum energy value from the above left, above, and above right pixels.

Step6:
The backtracking process starts from the bottom row and moves upwards, finding the 
path with the minimum accumulated energy in each row. It determines the column 
index of the next pixel in the seam based on the minimum energy values in the dynamic 
programming matrix. The result is a list of pixel coordinates representing the minimum 
energy seam from the bottom to the top of the image.
The loop in the code here, iterates in reverse order over the remaining rows (`for i in 
reversed(range(height - 1))`) and updates the `j` coordinate based on the minimum 
energy values:
-`if j == 0`: This condition checks if `j` is at the leftmost column. If true, it finds the 
index of the minimum energy value among the current pixel and its right neighbor.
-`elif j == width - 1`: This condition checks if `j` is at the rightmost column. If true, it 
finds the index of the minimum energy value among the current pixel and its left 
neighbor. The calculated index is adjusted by adding `j - 1` to get the correct position 
in the `dp` matrix.
-The `else` block handles the pixels in the middle columns. It finds the index of the 
minimum energy value among the current pixel, its left neighbor, and its right neighbor. 
The calculated index is adjusted by adding `j - 1` to get the correct position in the `dp` 
matrix.
-In each case, the resulting `j` value represents the column index of the next pixel in 
the minimum energy seam.

Step7:
The code segment removes the pixels along the minimum energy seam by setting them 
to white and crops the image to remove the seam entirely. The resulting image is then 
resized to the desired dimensions using the Lanczos resampling algorithm. This 
22
sequence of operations effectively resizes the image while preserving important visual 
content by removing less important seams.

Step8: Route handler function for the root URL ("/") of the Flask application
Here the code segment defines a route handler function named "index" that handles 
GET and POST requests to the root URL ("/"). It renders an HTML form to upload an 
image and process it. If the form is submitted and passes validation, the uploaded 
image is saved, and the user is redirected to the "resize" route to process the image. If 
the form is not submitted or does not pass validation, the form is rendered on the 
webpage. The HTML template used is "index1.html".
Overall, this route handler function handles the root URL ("/") of the application, 
renders the form template, and processes the form submission to upload an image file.

Step9: Route handler function for the "/resize/<filename>" URL of the Flask 
application.
The code segment defines a route handler function named "resize" that handles GET 
and POST requests to the "/resize/<filename>" URL. It processes uploaded images, 
retrieves the desired dimensions for resizing from a form, performs seam carving on 
the image, and saves the resized image. If the request method is POST, the image is 
processed and the result is displayed using the "result.html" template. If the request 
method is GET or the form submission fails validation, the "resize.html" template is 
rendered with the uploaded image and form displayed.
The code utilizes various modules such as `os`, `Image` from PIL, `Flask`, 
`render_template`, `request`, and `base64` for handling file paths, image processing, 
web application development, rendering templates, handling HTTP requests, and 
encoding image data. It combines these modules to provide functionality for 
uploading, resizing, and displaying the images through a web interface.

Step10: Main execution code for the Flask application
Overall, this code defines a route handler function for displaying the result of the 
resizing operation, where the resized image file is rendered using a template. The script 
also includes the main execution code to run the Flask application in debug mode.
